    "For now, average annual rainfall figures from long term historical records (1901-2017) have been used to determine the amount of runoff generated. While there exists inherent year to year variability in average rainfall, climate change predictions and community member accounts indicate decline in annual rainfall. According to the Australian agricultural ministry, recent research indicates a 10% reduction in rainfall can result in a 30% reduction in runoff, with a significant consequent impact on water supplies. Consideration should be given to the possibility of reduced and less reliable runoff and the impact of this on the frequency of pond filling and its supply.\n",
