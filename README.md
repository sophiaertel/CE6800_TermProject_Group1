# CE6800 Term Project - EWBGWU Bhutiya Water Management Program Collaboration
This project is in support of the Engineers Without Borders GWU Bhutiya Water Management Program, in their aim to combat climate change-driven water scarcity, over-exploitation of groundwater resources, and inefficient irrigation practices.

This project will inform the design process for an integrated dam-percolation pond system for the Bhutiya community. This code seeks to estimate expected rainfall, runoff conversion, and thereby the optimal dimensions and design of the proposed system.
