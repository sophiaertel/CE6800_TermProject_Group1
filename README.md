# CE6800 Term Project - EWBGWU Bhutiya Water Management Program Collaboration
This project is in support of the Engineers Without Borders GWU Bhutiya Water Management Program, in their aim to combat climate change-driven water scarcity, over-exploitation of groundwater resources, and inefficient irrigation practices.

This project will inform the design process for an integrated dam-percolation pond system for the Bhutiya community. This code seeks to estimate expected rainfall, runoff conversion, and thereby the optimal dimensions and design of the proposed system.

# Process Notes

Phase I Notes (Olivia):

Phase II Notes (Sophia):
	In order to properly size the dam and catchment system (Phase III) given expected rainfall (Phase I), the expected precipitation must be converted to runoff. The catchment yield of the system will be a function of direct runoff dependent on the basic watershed hydrology. The system will not collect the total amount of rainfall falling over the draining area. Instead, catchment yield will be controlled by factors of evaporation, infiltration, depression storage, and canopy interception (to name a few). In equation form the water balance approach looks like this:
Streamflow Q = Precipitation P -  (Transpiration+Evaporation) T - Infiltration I - Soil Storage S	

Based on preliminary analysis and literature review, it may be necessary to perform Thiessien Polygon or Isohyetal methods of hydraulic modeling to understand how rainfall affects sub-watersheds within the drainage area. Numerous softwares are available online including HEC-HMS and SWAT are currently being investigated as tools to simulate the quality and quantity of surface and ground water and predict the environmental impact of land use, land management practices, and climate change.
For the first iteration of the hydraulic model a simple equation was adapted from the Australian Agricultural Ministry.
